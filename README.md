> **Abstract:** *Existing face restoration models have relied on general assessment metrics that do not consider the characteristics of facial regions, resulting in a low correlation with human visual perception. Recent works have therefore assessed their methods using human studies, which is not scalable and involves significant effort. This paper proposes a novel face-centric metric based on an adversarial framework in which a generator simulates face restoration and a discriminator provides image quality assessment. Specifically, our per-pixel discriminator enables interpretable evaluation that cannot be provided by traditional metrics. Moreover, our metric emphasizes facial primary regions considering that even minor changes to the eyes, nose, and mouth significantly affect human cognition. Our face-oriented metric consistently surpasses existing general or facial image quality assessment metrics by impressive margins. We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed strategy in various architectural designs and challenging scenarios. Interestingly, we find that our PFQE can lead to performance improvement as an objective function.*
